Coffee Log test

Making an espresso is another way of brewing coffee. For me it's called the safest way to make coffee because of how much you can tweak the coffee's flavor with milk and you can top it off with sugar, depending on who will drink it. I've been making espresso for almost 3 years and just this year that I've been mindful with how I make it. Grind size matters, the milk, how you tamp it, and so on. There's a lot at stake when making an espresso.

Whenever I make one for other people, there's this slight pressure I get because one's coffee taste is different from the other and it has been bugging me for 2 weeks now that when I make coffee for other people, should I tweak the coffee depending on how they like it or depending on my machine's and my own capabilities.

I pulled a great espresso today with Cerrado beans from the Good Cup. I tweaked my grind size to a finer one and pulled a great one. This is what I like about brewing coffee at home. You can tweak it how you like because you have all the power to do so and it feels really great when you make a good cup of coffee.
